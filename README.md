# Sample LinkedListView

-
Just more complicated Sample for using [LinkedListView library](https://github.com/GensaGames/LinkedListView) for Android. This Project contains a lot of other things and in this scope - complex List Items with different tranlsation during scrolling. See code for more details. 

We will update the Project for other interesting samples based on LinkedListView. Also this work optimized for Nexus 4 Resolution (API 23 768-1280), and maybe later will have other screens support.
